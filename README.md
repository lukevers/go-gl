# go-gl

This repo contains code for [Go](http://golang.org/) [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) bindings.

## Why are you doing this?

Yes I know there's [go-gl-legacy](https://github.com/go-gl-legacy) and [go-gl](https://github.com/go-gl), and that's where a lot of these original packages come from, but I either couldn't get them to compile properly or had to change import paths constantly until it worked. There's also a benefit of maintaining your own fork of something. I'll make sure to update this repo with any changes the other repos make if needed, and I'll also update them myself with whatever code I seem to need that these libraries don't have.

## License

This repo is oringally code that [I](https://github.com/lukevers) did not write from the start, but updated to either have fixed paths or other issues with the code and collected all in one repository. Each package has their own LICENSE file and you can view them, along with the list of contributors in each package.
